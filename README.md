# Dutch

I call it Dutch, for lack of a better name. This application uses data from the [Public Register Regular Labour and Highly Skilled Migrants](https://ind.nl/en/public-register-recognised-sponsors/public-register-regular-labour-and-highly-skilled-migrants), and presents the list of companies under categories, and searchable.

Maybe should be called PRRLHSM.

The application has no backend. It's an Angular 18+ SPA.
