# Dutch

I call it Dutch, for lack of a better name. This application uses data from the [Public Register Regular Labour and Highly Skilled Migrants](https://ind.nl/en/public-register-recognised-sponsors/public-register-regular-labour-and-highly-skilled-migrants), and presents the list of companies under categories, and searchable.

Maybe should be called PRRLHSM.

The application has no backend. It's an Angular 18+ SPA.

See the live application running at [dutch.khophi.com](dutch.khophi.com)

The JavaScript script is designed to:

1. Read: Take a JSON file (`organizations.json`) containing company data (names, IDs, etc.).
2. Analyze: Use an AI model ([Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) running locally) to enrich each company's data. The AI provides a description, categorizes the company into a specific sector, finds its website, and suggests relevant tags. Learn more about how to set up your [local Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) running service on their official website
3. Structure: Organize the enriched company information into a well-structured JSON format (`output.json`). Companies are grouped by their sector.
4. Handle Errors: Log any errors that occur during the process to a separate file (`error_log.json`).

This script is a web scraper designed to extract specific data from the website [Public Register Regular Labour and Highly Skilled Migrants](https://ind.nl/en/public-register-recognised-sponsors/public-register-regular-labour-and-highly-skilled-migrants). 

It uses the following libraries:

* fs (File System): Saves the extracted data into a JSON file.
